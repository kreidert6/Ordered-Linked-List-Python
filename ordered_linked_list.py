        DO NOT simply create an empty orderedLinkedList object, and then
        insert each item in self and other_ordered_list into that new orderedLinkedList
        obect.  You must merge the items from self and 
        other_ordered_list into a newly created linked list, that operates in O(n) 
        running time, where n is the total number of items in both lists.

        Duplicates are allowed.
        Leave self and other_ordered_list unchanged, so do not remove 
        the items from either list.  Just copy their items into your newly
        created list.  And don't try to reuse the nodes from either self
        or other_ordered_list.  You want to just copy the items from their nodes.

        (the list calling the method), 
        and the items in other_ordered_list, and this new list is returned.
        All items that appear in both lists should
        be in the intersection list.  You should keep just one copy of each item that
        appears in both lists, so for example,
        if there are two copies of an item in the self list, and 3 copies in the
        other_ordered_list list, then just one copy should be in the intersection.
        (Also, as another example, if there are 2 copies in the self list and 0 copies
        in the other list, then no copies should be in the intersection list.)
        You must find the intersection of self and other_ordered_list in one
        pass through both lists, and so its running time should be O(n), where n is 
        the total number of items in both lists.
        (This should have a similar feel to the merge operation.)
        Leave self and other_ordered_list unchanged, so do not remove 
        the items from either list.  Just copy their items into your newly
